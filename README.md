## Setup
This is a simple download and installation of the Dependencies.

The executable are the following:
- p2p-sockets.py
- rsa_cli.py

The **p2p-sockets.py** is the standalone implementation of the RSA with sockets, Is capable of encrypted communication 
with the use of cryptodome and some functions, this is the **Peer to Peer** version.
